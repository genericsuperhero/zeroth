upsilon_decrypt.c is a shell of C program for an XOR decrypter.

upsilon_payload.py is a script that generates a Metasploit payload, XOR encrypts it,
generates a temporary C program, and then compiles it.

These fils expect to be in the root directory of a Metasploit SVN copy. If they
aren't you will need to adjust variables.
